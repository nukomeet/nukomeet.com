People often asks me how I would define a « great company ». Some would say it's
about earning money, it's business after all. Other would argue it's about
creating a product people need and care about. In eyes of many, best companies
are these who fulfil objectives for its clients and stakeholders in the first
place - while not false, we tend to favor company’s external
activity when asked the question. Those characteristics, however, should be a consequence
as they refer to company's performance. It is not intense pressure, hard 
exploitation nor unfair affinity illusion, but internal well-being and integrity 
which should produce excellent results.

The company essence is people who decided to work together; it's a preliminary
ingredient which is necessary to fulfil company's objectives. Great companies
are those that focus on people. One of my favourite indicators of a great
company is the number of people that left or was fired, I call it « people
rotation metric ». Usually, the lower it stays the better the company seems.
When people leave it's usually company's fault: when people's expectations diverge,
it's a company responsibility to facilitate and reduce the tension; when people's
goals rise, the company must keep up. Once this metric rises 
considerably, people are not treated as they should - there is something wrong
whether related to pressure, exploitation or the way « together » is perceived.

At Nukomeet, we believe in a lifetime commitment when it comes to forming a work
environment. We set up a flat structure not to make an illusion for decisions
making, but to truly and fully consolidate people within. It is only possible
with an identical chance to act and perform which correspond to a flat and equal
ownership of the company. It's only the work that can make the difference.
There is no other way around, otherwise it's just another golden cage.

And what are your metrics that may define a great company ?
